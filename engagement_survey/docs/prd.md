## Requirement Analysis:
The product should be an engagement survey app that allows users to create and manage surveys, send surveys to participants, collect and analyze survey responses, generate reports, and customize the survey design and branding.

## Requirement Pool:
```python
[
    ("Users should be able to create and manage surveys", "P0"),
    ("Users should be able to send surveys to participants", "P0"),
    ("Users should be able to collect and analyze survey responses", "P0"),
    ("Users should be able to generate reports based on survey data", "P1"),
    ("Users should be able to customize the survey design and branding", "P1")
]
```

## UI Design draft:
The app should have a clean and intuitive user interface. It should include the following elements:

- Survey creation and management: Users should be able to create new surveys, edit existing surveys, and delete surveys.
- Participant management: Users should be able to add and remove participants for each survey.
- Survey sending: Users should be able to send surveys to participants via email or shareable links.
- Survey response collection: The app should collect and store survey responses from participants.
- Analytics and reporting: Users should be able to view and analyze survey responses, generate reports, and export data.
- Customization: Users should be able to customize the survey design, including colors, fonts, and branding elements.

The layout should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. The style should be modern and visually appealing.
