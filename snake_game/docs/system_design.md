## Implementation approach:
For the implementation of the command-line snake game, we will use the following open-source tools:

1. `curses` library: This library provides a terminal-independent way of creating text-based interfaces. It will be used to handle keyboard input and display the game screen.

2. `random` module: This module will be used to generate random positions for the food item in the game.

3. `time` module: This module will be used to control the speed of the game by introducing delays between each frame.

## Python package name:
```python
"snake_game"
```

## File list:
```python

```

## Data structures and interface definitions:
```mermaid

    class Game{
        -int score
        -int width
        -int height
        -int delay
        -int direction
        -list[int] snake_x
        -list[int] snake_y
        -int food_x
        -int food_y
        -bool game_over
        +__init__(self, width: int, height: int, delay: int)
        +init_game(self)
        +draw_border(self)
        +draw_snake(self)
        +draw_food(self)
        +display_score(self)
        +get_user_input(self)
        +move_snake(self)
        +check_collision(self)
        +game_loop(self)
        +start(self)
    }
```

## Program call flow:
```mermaid

    participant M as Main
    M->>Game: start()
    Game->>Game: init_game()
    Game->>Game: game_loop()
    Game->>Game: draw_border()
    Game->>Game: draw_snake()
    Game->>Game: draw_food()
    Game->>Game: display_score()
    Game->>Game: get_user_input()
    Game->>Game: move_snake()

    Game->>Game: display_score()
    Game->>Game: get_user_input()
    Game->>Game: restart

## Anything UNCLEAR:
The requirements are clear and there are no unclear points.
