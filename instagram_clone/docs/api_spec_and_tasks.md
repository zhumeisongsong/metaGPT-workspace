## Task list:

```python
[
    "main.py",
    "models.py",
    "views.py",
    "serializers.py",

]
```

## Shared Knowledge:

```python
"""
The 'utils.py' file contains utility functions that can be used throughout the application. It is recommended to review the functions in this file and understand how they can be used in other modules.

The 'settings.py' file contains the configuration settings for the application. It is important to review and update these settings according to the project requirements.

The 'api.py' file contains the API endpoints for user authentication, photo upload, social network features, and notifications. It is the main file where the API logic should be implemented.

The 'database.py' file contains the functions for interacting with the PostgreSQL database. It is recommended to review and understand these functions as they will be used for database operations.

The 'auth.py' file contains the functions for user authentication and authorization. It is important to review and understand these functions to ensure the security of the application.
