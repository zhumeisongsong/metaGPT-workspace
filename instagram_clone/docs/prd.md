## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a user-friendly and visually appealing React app that allows users to upload and share photos. It should also have social networking features such as the ability to follow other users, like and comment on photos, and discover new users.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("User authentication: Implement a secure login and registration system", "P0"),
    ("Photo upload: Allow users to upload and share their photos", "P0"),
    ("Social network features: Implement the ability to follow other users, like and comment on photos", "P0"),
    ("Explore page: Create a page where users can discover new users and explore their photos", "P1"),
    ("Notifications: Notify users about new likes, comments, and followers", "P2")
]
```

## UI Design draft
The app will have a clean and modern design with a navigation bar at the top for easy access to different sections of the app. The home page will display a feed of photos from the users that the logged-in user follows. Each photo will have options to like and comment on it. Users will also have their own profile page where they can upload and manage their photos. The explore page will show recommended users and their photos. The design will use a combination of white and light gray backgrounds with colorful accents for buttons and icons.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There are no unclear points.
